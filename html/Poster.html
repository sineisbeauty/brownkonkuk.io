                        <h3>Effect on tumor growth in systems of two different types of tumor-associated neutrophils: A
                            mathematical model</h3>
                        <p> Glioblastoma, one of the deadly cancers with low survival rates derived from high recurrence
                            and metastasis rate, have been treated in difficulty due to anatomical features of the human
                            brain structure. Neutrophils, one of the anticancer agents in tumor microenvironment, have
                            been regarded as a breakthrough of this situation because of its effective performance in
                            the brain tissue; however, their usages for clinics are in hesitate due to controversial
                            reports from studies: both tumor-promoting and tumor-inhibiting effects are reported. In
                            this study, we build a mathematical model of interaction among the TME including tumor cells
                            and two different tumor-associated neutrophils: the anti-tumorigenic N1 and the tumorigenic
                            N2. Using neutrophil-related cytokines such as IFN-β and TGF-β, and antibody which
                            selectively eliminates N2 neutrophils, we investigate dynamical variances among two
                            competing neutrophils under different stimuli conditions and see how tumor cells grow
                            according to these situations. To apply the model to the glioblastoma therapy, we develop a
                            simulation which includes partial differential equations (PDEs) and a hybrid method approach
                            to examine a spatial operation of tumor cells under temporal progression in the complex
                            human brain anatomy.</p>

                        <h3>Machine Learning of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transitions during Collective and Individual
                            Migration</h3>
                        <p>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with transitions from stationary
                            tissues towards collective and individual migration during embryonic development, wound
                            healing and tumor progression. For example, activation of EMT transcription factors weaken
                            cell-cell adhesion and promote cell-matrix adhesion with front-back polarity. Recently,
                            partial or hybrid EMT states have been suggested that retain some cell-cell adhesions and
                            act as “leader cells” to coordinate collective migration. However, profiling the functional
                            phenotypes of partial EMT states remains challenging since they are transient and depend on
                            local microenvironmental conditions. Here, we use live cell imaging of EMT fluorescent
                            reporters coupled with machine learning to profile EMT states in mammary epithelial cells
                            after TGF-beta treatment. We found that although we can roughly distinguish between
                            epithelial and mesenchymal states using either cell morphology or fluorescent reporter
                            output as separate methods, classifying cells within partial EMT subgroups remain
                            challenging. By integrating reporter expression with morphology classification, we identify
                            distinct subgroups of partial EMT cells that exhibit unique migration patterns within the
                            monolayer. For instance, under intermediate TGF-beta treatment, larger cells marked with the
                            epithelial marker demonstrate active "leading" migration, while smaller cells are
                            "passively" steered by their neighbors. Moreover, the increase in heterogeneity within
                            neighboring cells, including a rise in 'leader-like' cells, significantly enhances the
                            robustness and dynamics of cell migration. Consequently, the EMT-induced cell population
                            demonstrates stronger and more sustained collective migration. We envision this approach can
                            be applied more broadly to elucidate single cell plasticity across epithelial and
                            mesenchymal states during collective migration in the context of development and disease.

                        <h3>Collective Transitions from Orbiting to Matrix Invasion in 3D Multicellular Spheroids</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coordinated cell rotation along a curved matrix interface can sculpt epithelial tissues into
                            spherical morphologies. Subsequently, radially-oriented invasion of multicellular strands or
                            branches can occur by local remodeling of the confining matrix. These symmetry-breaking
                            transitions emerge from the dynamic reciprocity between cells and matrix, but remain poorly
                            understood. Here, we show that epithelial cell spheroids collectively transition from
                            circumferential orbiting to radial invasion via bi-directional interactions with the
                            surrounding matrix curvature. Initially, spheroids exhibit an ellipsoidal shape but become
                            rounded as orbiting occurs. However, cells gradually reorient from coordinated rotation
                            towards outward strand invasion due to the accumulation of contractile tractions at discrete
                            sites. Remarkably, the initial ellipsoid morphology predicts subsequent invasion of 2-4
                            strands roughly aligned with the major axis. We then perturb collective migration using
                            osmotic pressure, showing that orbiting can be arrested and invasion can be reversed. We
                            also investigate coordinated orbiting in “mosaic” spheroids, showing a small fraction of
                            “leader” cells with weakened cell-cell adhesions can impede collective orbiting but still
                            invade into the matrix. Finally, we establish a minimal self-propelled particle model to
                            elucidate how collective orbiting is mediated by the crosstalk of cell-cell and cell-matrix
                            adhesion along a curved boundary. Altogether, this work elucidates how tissue morphogenesis
                            is governed by the interplay of collective behaviors and the local curvature of the
                            cell-matrix, with relevance for embryonic development and tumor progression.

                        <p>
                            Neutrophils play a crucial role in the innate immune response as a first line of defense in
                            many diseases, including cancer. Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) can either promote or
                            inhibit tumor growth in various steps of cancer progression via mutual interactions with
                            cancer cells in a complex tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we developed and
                            analyzed mathematical models to investigate the role of natural killer cells (NK cells) and
                            the dynamic transition between N1 and N2 TAN phenotypes in killing cancer cells through key
                            signaling networks and how adjuvant therapy with radiation can be used in combination to
                            increase anti-tumor efficacy. We examined the complex immune-tumor dynamics among N1/N2
                            TANs, NK cells, and tumor cells, communicating through key extracellular mediators
                            (Transforming growth factor (TGF-beta), Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)) and intracellular
                            regulation in the apoptosis signaling network. We developed several tumor prevention
                            strategies to eradicate tumors, including combination (IFN-gamma, exogenous NK,
                            TGF-βinhibitor) therapy and optimally-controlled ionizing radiation in a complex TME. Using
                            this model, we investigated the fundamental mechanism of radiation-induced changes in the
                            TME and the impact of internal and external immune composition on the tumor cell fate and
                            their response to different treatment schedules.

                        <h3>Glioma Infiltration between Astrocytes and Blood Vessels </h3>
                        <p>
                            "Gliomas are highly lethal tumors, often leading to patient mortality within one year of
                            diagnosis.
                            A major challenge in treating gliomas is their extensive invasion, which allows tumor cells
                            to
                            evade surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Glioma cells migrate along
                            blood vessels, squeezing through narrow spaces between astrocytic endfeet and blood vessels,
                            while reducing their volume by up to 33%. This volume regulation is closely linked to ion
                            channels, particularly involving chloride (Cl-) and calcium (Ca2+) ions. In this study, we
                            focused on the interactions between these ions and how they contribute to volume regulation
                            in
                            glioma cells. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying this process, we aim to identify
                            strategies to inhibit glioma cell migration, thereby preventing tumor metastasis.
                            Additionally,
                            we investigated how drug interventions could further inhibit this migratory behavior,
                            offering
                            potential therapeutic approaches to limit glioma progression."
